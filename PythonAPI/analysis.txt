There are at least three observable trends in this data.  First, the latitude seems to have an indirect relationship to the temperature, that is a greater latitude does not result in a greater temperature, at least in the northern hemisphere.  Second, the overall wind speed seems to be greatest when the latitude is either negative or approaching 0.  Third, in the northern hemisphere the latitude and humidity do not seem to be very related at all.  Finally, just a note for this dataset, there seems to be plenty of data for the northern hemisphere and not enough for the Southern Hemisphere.  However, that could simply be a result of my small sample size as I do not want to get charged for going over the API request quota for openweather.
