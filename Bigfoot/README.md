# "The ability to take raw data from different datasets, examine the content and draw a conclusion."
As young data analysts, we all want to impress our teachers and possibly employers with our newly acquired skills. So we try to find challenging and complex cases for our analysis to show the seriousness of our commitment to the class. Our group thinks the topic's severity should not dictate how we treat this project's process. Instead, we should be able to provide the same level of focus and diligence to all datasets.

During the brainstorming session on our initiation phase, we discussed a series of possible topics. At this fork on the road, we talked about how we can treat the "sasquatch affair," a light topic like this, with respect and professionalism.
After agreeing that we would face the same problems inherent in data analysis, or possibly more due to the topic's nature, we continued forward with the project and identified the scope and type of obscurities that we would study. After a short search that proved successful and plentiful, we moved to the planning phase, assigned tasks, and executed the plan.

The original data came on a CSV file, and Jupyter notebook was used to import both pandas for cleaning the data and JSON to create the .json files.

Javascript was used to write the codes to visualize the plots with plotly and the creation of the dropdown menu to show the description of the events while Leaflet was used for maps and makers with popup info. We included a fun add-on with granim that adds a color fade effect to the background picture.

We used HTML to describe the structure of our webpage and CSS for Style.
The end product is a web page that shows the visualization of the sightings for both aliens and bigfoot in the United States, and they are offered on a cluster of events across the country. To accomplish this, we used the lat-long info available for each event.

For the plots, the data by state shows where, in the country, we have a better chance of sightings.
Shapes define the preferred intergalactic form for space travel, and just in case you were wondering, we added an analysis of the moon phase; Sasquatch is a bit shy around a full moon. Thus, we present "mapping the truth."


Enjoy.
